# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Techniques in R

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of unsupervised learning techniques, specifically focusing on clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their behavior. The project is implemented in R and uses the Mall Customers dataset for practical application.

## Project Overview

We apply various clustering methods to group customers by similar characteristics, such as age, annual income, and spending score. These techniques help uncover behavioral patterns and support strategic decisions like personalized marketing or product targeting.

The main clustering methods explored in this project include:

- K-Means Clustering

- Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)

- Density-Based Clustering (DBSCAN)

The optimal number of clusters is evaluated using different internal metrics such as:

- Silhouette Coefficient

- Elbow Method (WCSS)

- Calinski-Harabasz Index

- Davies-Bouldin Index

Each technique is implemented using R’s rich data analysis ecosystem, with visualizations and comparisons to assess the quality of clustering.

## Goals of the Analysis

- Identify distinct customer groups

- Visualize customer behavior in 2D and 3D spaces

- Compare clustering techniques and evaluate their performance

- Support data-driven business decisions through segmentation

## Technologies and libraries used

- R

- tidyverse

- factoextra

- cluster

- dbscan

- fpc

- clusterCrit

- plotly
